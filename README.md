A proof of concept of Nestjs working with snowflake and graphql.

Run the sql file in `database/todo.sql` on your snowflake instance.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the credentials to connect with your instance.

Run `yarn start:dev` to start the project in `watch` mode.

Access `http://localhost:3000/graphql` to access the `playground` with the schema file.

Be happy ;)
